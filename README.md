#Convex Hull Visualizer

This Android app is currently under development. The purpose of the program is to visualize computational geometry algorithms (ex: Graham Scan) to generate convex hulls for a series of points inputted by the user. View the app on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.horatiu.convex_hull_visualizer)

##Features
* Allows user to plot points on a canvas
* Permits user to customize canvas using multi-touch gestures and through settings screen
* Features color customization and edge/node size
* Generates convex hull using Graham Scan algorithm in O(NlogN) time

##Further Development
* Include Grift-Wrapping Algorithm O(N*H)
* Include nice animations
