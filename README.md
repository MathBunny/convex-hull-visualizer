#Convex Hull Visualizer

This application is currently under development. The purpose of the program is to visualize computational geometry algorithms (ex: Graham Scan) to generate convex hulls for a series of points inputted by the user.

##Progress
* Added grid implementation
* Functioning Graham Scan algorithm in O(NlogN) time

##Further Development
* Include multi-touch gestures to zoom in/out
* Include Grift-Wrapping Algorithm O(N*H)
* Include settings to change graphic settings
* Add nice icon
